          <p>
            Based on the development history of lithography machine, this report demonstrates that the basic research is the source of original technological innovation, and integrated innovation is the necessity for high-end product research and development. Through the development stages of the Internet, the report points out that such system-level products as the Internet are also high-tech products and further proposes an innovative thinking mode of system engineering as the four-dimensional space "science, technology, engineering, industry". Finally, the report introduces the future products industrial Internet and analyze the main problems, architecture and future development opportunities.

            The connected object of the first-generation Internet is computer, and its applications are primarily social communication and marketing; The secondgeneration Internet is the Internet of things (IoT), which has widely applied in various industries and living services. The application of digital twin expands the connected objects of the IoT into physical objects and their virtual twins, thus integrates the physical and virtual object space into a virtual-real hybrid space —Digital Twin Network（DTN） . Developing the Internet of Things into a new generation of DTN can greatly improve the efficiency of production and service operations in various industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            We should actively develop the DTN to provide interconnected support for the in-depth VR applications in various physical industries. The new generation of digital twin networks, combined with software and hardware VR infrastructure such as cloud VR platform, VR data center, VR model center, VR engine and content production platform, can comprehensively support the VR industry chain and construction and formation of the industry ecology, thereby promoting the rapid and healthy development of the VR industry .

          <p>
            The world is undergoing a momentous changes unseen in a century, and the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation has already entered a new historical starting point. Under the impact of new science revolution and industrial transformation, Chinese information-technology industry is facing new challenges on its development. So the times call for new ideas and practices in the development of science and technology industry. Guided by "goal orientation, problem orientation and effect orientation", this report will profoundly explore the formation of the world's science and technology industry pattern and the development of future Chinese science and technology industry from the following three dimensions: scientific and technological system, industrial system and institutional system. Taking the construction of quantum science and technology industry as an example, the report will describe the process of how Chinese scientists get rid of the shackles of Western science and technology industry and build an independent and controllable science and technology industry system. Guided by the scientific and social system engineering method, we will continue to liberate and develop the productive forces, and to promote the new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way through the continuous construction of the scientific and technological industrial system.

            Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a major force in machine learning and have achieved great success across many domains. However, DNNs may behave in highly non robust ways when presented with perturbed examples at either training or test time. In this talk we explore 3 important types of perturbations: adversarial, noisy label and unlearnable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adversarial examples are well known to the research community and correspond to specially perturbed inputs that fool DNNs into making false predictions with high confidence. Noisy label examples arise when a significant fraction of class labels in the training is incorrect, making it challenging to fit an accurate model. Unlearnable examples are a more recent phenomenon and correspond to training data that undergoes small intentional perturbations that make it useless for model training, whilst preserving utility for human visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this talk we compare and contrast these three types of perturbations, examine their impact on the robustness of DNNs, mitigation strategies, and consider their broader implications for robust machine learning.

          <h4>Abstract</h4>
          <p>Data workers and platforms are facing a number of challenges that have emerged from re-purposing of data and lack of data quality awareness. In this talk, I will outline how human centred perspectives can assist in overcoming some of these challenges to achieve responsible and efficient use of data.</p>
          <!-- <p>
            Today many applications requiring to analyze and process a massive amount of data (e.g. scientific workflows) rely on business processes that span different organizations. This may pose serious security and privacy threats to the data each organisation exposes during the collaboration. The weak trust relationships that may hold among the collaborating parties result in a potential lack of trust in how data/operations are managed by the different business partners. The need for a trustworthy way to support composite service certification becomes crucial to guarantee efficiency and transparency. A promising approach to tackle this issue is leveraging on blockchain. This brings the benefits of trust decentralization, transparency, and accountability of the service composition and management process. The talk will describe a blockchain based framework we have developed to deal with the privacy and security challenges in executing inter-organisational business processes on the blockchain.

          <h4>Abstract</h4>
          <p>In recent years, deep learning (DL) has significantly penetrated and has been widely adopted in various fields of application, including facial recognition, strategy games (AlphaGo and Texas hold'em) and question answering. However, the effectiveness of the models and efficiency of the training process strongly depend on how well the associated data is managed. It is very challenging to train an effective deep learning-based image classifier without properly labelled training data. Furthermore, training efficiency is severely affected by a large amount of training data, complex structures of the models and tones of hyper parameters. A lack of validation for result data and explanation also seriously affect the applicability of trained models. In this talk, I will discuss three issues on how to manage data for effective and efficient deep learning: 1) how to prepare data for effective DL, which includes data extraction and integration as well as data labelling; 2) how to optimize DL training, including data compression and computation graph optimization; and 3) how to conduct explanation to make the model robust and transparent. Some future work will be highlighted at the end.</p>
